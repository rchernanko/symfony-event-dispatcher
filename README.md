#Practice - Symfony Event Dispatcher

- My notes based on the symfony component event dispatcher tutorial on the laracasts website
- https://laracasts.com/series/discover-symfony-components/episodes/4

##Set up

All I did to create this project (and this can be applied to any symfony projects):

- mkdir <project_name>
- cd <project_name>
- composer require symfony/event-dispatcher

Of course, this assumes I already have composer installed on my device
